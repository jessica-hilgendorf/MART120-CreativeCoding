    <h1><center>Bear Meets Owl in the Woods</center></h1>
    <p>In this project, I used Scratch to create a short story about a bear who meets a friend in the woods. It was a lot of fun to use the program's interactive features to drag and drop bits of code. I created a couple of characters and backgrounds to help give the illusion of a change in camera angles. My favorite part of this project was using the "broadcasting" feature to trigger other events as the story progressed. I had a lot of fun setting the scene and making background sounds and music.</p>
